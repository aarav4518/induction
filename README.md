## 🌟 A Memorable Beginning to Our College Journey

Our journey as engineering students at **Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC)** began on a spiritual note 🙏. We sought the divine blessings of **Shri Guru Nanak Dev Ji** at the **Gurdwara Sahib**, where the soothing *Shabad Kirtan* set a peaceful and inspiring tone for the day.  

Following the prayer, we were warmly served a delicious treat of **samosas, pakoras, tea, and cold drinks** 🍵🥟, adding a touch of traditional hospitality to the occasion.
